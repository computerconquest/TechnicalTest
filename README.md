# The scenario

Imagine you have been tasked to create a basic reporting application that will allow someone to view profitability and sales via a web portal.

We currently have a fairly basic C#/.Net core/WebApi/Entity Framework backend which provides a list of clients, products and sales history. A handful of endpoints have been included to supply some details about those.

Unfortunately, we've come to realise that a large amount of income from a client does not necessarily indicate that the client is highly profitable as there's a cost associated with each product. Some products are more profitable than others.

We would like a simple picture that makes it clearer which clients are the most profitable, so we know who to schmooze!

n.b. There may be issues with this application. You might need to fix things. There might be things that aren't best practices, so fix any major issues you spot, let us know anything else you see.

# Timebox

We'd like you to timebox this. Your time is important. We normally budget about an hour for this, but as this is a take home thing, we can't set a time limit for you. Please! Anything more than a couple hours is probably excessive.

# Installation

## Requirements

- NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/
- DotNet 5 SDK https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0
- Visual Studio Code (Or Visual Studio) https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Running

- Open a Terminal in VS Code

```
    cd ClientData
    npm install
    cd ..
    dotnet run
```

# What to do

1. Update the basic reporting portal using the supplied .Net/Angular framework (I know! It's very basic, but it should do the job!)
2. Designs have been supplied, but some artistic liberty is available! Show off what you can do! The current form is roughly there, but definitely not perfect! üòÅ
3. What sort of user experience improvements would you make?
4. Given profitability is important, what other metrics might be really useful to know?
5. What sort of unit tests would you want for this app?

Feel free to add any comments you want to the bottom of this or send it to us at the end.

# The results

This is a mix of practical (this is the sort of work you might be asked to do) as well as creative.

There's no right way or wrong way to do this.

Use whatever tools/Google-fu you'd normally use. Also feel free to ask questions. We're working together on this and your interviewer is a viable and helpful resource.

We're looking to see how you approach the task, what tools you currently like to use and how you use them.

Please be well aware, you have an hour to do this and you can't do everything. Prioritisation is important!
